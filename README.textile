h1. Old Yeller

is dead.

You know Frank Sinatra?

He's dead.

Large chunks of your existing code base?

Dead.

OldYeller is a tool to track down dead code in Rails applications.  It sizes
your application up and let's you know which methods, partials, views, or 
classes are never called.

To use Old Yeller, copy @./dead_code.rb.example@ to your @RAILS_ROOT@, modify
any parameters that need it and run

@rake old_yeller@

Old Yeller works by generating tests from @config/routes@ to request every 
accessible page.  These tests are run through RCov to generate a report on
which app code is used or not used.  Tooling is added to 
@ActionView::Template@ to determine which templates are actually rendered.

h2. Requirements

Proper care and feeding of Old Yeller is facilitated by a couple of gems:

* Shoulda
* RCov
* Rails
